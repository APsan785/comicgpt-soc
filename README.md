My SOC Project of ComicGPT in which we have to use stable diffusion to generate images from text prompts. The main aim is to generate a storyline and a comic out of it.

Learnings - 
  => Prompt engineering for image generation
  => Learnt about neural networks and basic ML
  => Learnt Stable diffusion and how are images generated
  => Using colab notebook for the coding part
  => Used huggingface for implementing/using the algorithms of stable diffusion
